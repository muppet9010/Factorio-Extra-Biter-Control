[mod-setting-description]
starting_evolution_percentage=The game will start at this evolution percentage and not be allowed to go below it. Game default value is "0". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
maximum_evolution_percentage=The game will not be able to have evolution above this percentage. Game default value is "100". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
biter_collision_box_percent=Set the biters collision box percentage of default. A smaller collision box allows them to move around each other easier, but also more can attack a building at once. Suggested reduction is to "40" percent. Game default value is "100". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
spitter_collision_box_percent=Set the spitters collision box percentage of default. A smaller collision box allows them to move around each other easier, but also more can attack a building at once. Suggested reduction is to "40" percent. Game default value is "100". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
min_pursue_time_ticks=The minimum time that all biters and spitters will pursue for regardless of distance, before giving up. Game default value is "600". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
max_pursue_distance_tiles=The maximum tiles that pursuing biters and spitters will pursue for before giving up. Game default value is "50". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
vision_distance_tiles=How many tiles a biter or spitter will spot targets at. Game default value is "30". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
immune_to_belts=Biters and spitters are not affected by belts. Game default value is "No".
spawner_pollution_absorbtion_max=Maximum pollution each spawner is able to absorb per tick. Game default value is "20". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
spawner_pollution_absorbtion_percent=Percentage of areas pollution each spawner will try to absorb per tick. Game default value is "1". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
spawner_max_units_map=How many units the spawner can have concurrently on the map not including those in an attacking party. Game default value is "7". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
spawner_max_units_local=The limit of nearby (default 10 tiles) friendly units this spawner will stop producing new units at, will include other spawner's units within area. Some of this spawners units will patrol beyond the nearby radius at times and so not be counted during this time. Game default value is "5". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
spawner_spawning_cooldown_min_evolution_ticks=The tick cooldown on spawners making units when evolution is at 0%. Sliding scale based on evolution percentage. Game default value is "360". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
spawner_spawning_cooldown_max_evolution_ticks=The tick cooldown on spawners making units when evolution is at 100%. Sliding scale based on evolution percentage. Game default value is "150". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
spawner_call_for_help_radius_tiles=The range (tiles) that a spawner will call in biters from when it is attacked. Game default value is "50". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
worm_call_for_help_radius_tiles=The range (tiles) that a worm (turret) will call in biters from when it is attacked. Game default value is "40". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
pathfinder_max_long_paths=Maximum concurrent long path (over 100 tiles) processing tasks that will be done. Over-rights the config key "max_clients_to_accept_any_new_request". Higher values may cause lag. Game default value is "10". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
pathfinder_max_short_paths=Maximum concurrent total path (long and short) processing tasks that will be done. Over-rights the config key "max_clients_to_accept_short_new_request". Higher values may cause lag. Game default value is "100". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
pathfinder_max_steps_worked_per_tick=Maximum number of steps processed per tick. Increasing this reduces biter pathfinding waits, but increases max UPS usage for pathfinding. Game default value is "100". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
blood=Disabling death blood reduces UPS spikes when killing large groups of enemies. Game default value is on, but it can't be forced on via the mod.
corpse_decay_seconds=How long in seconds biter and spitter corpses take to decay. Very high numbers of corpses can cause high FPS load. Game default value is "900", 15 minutes. "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod. Setting to 0 will not create any biter and spitter corpses.
maximum_gathering_unit_groups=How many enemy unit groups can be gathering for an attack at the same time. Game default value is "30". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
maximum_unit_group_size=Maximum number of enemy units that can be in an attack group. Game default value is "200". "-1" to remain unchanged by this mod.
